# youtube-not-interested-history
A Chromium extension to keep a history of how often you have to tell youtube to not recommend a channel or video

# To Do:
## I will probably forget all about this by the time I actually have time to make it, so here's what I'm thinking
1. Keep a local copy (gotta learn how 'local' works with web extensions) of accounts
2. With each 'Don\'t recommend channel', add it to the list (or increment the count) of channels to not recommend
3. With each 'Not interested', add the video title and channel name to the list (or increment the count) of videos to not recommend
4. Maybe add a pop up to add tags like 'Plants', 'Gardening', 'Iris Versicolor' to see how often you have to deny a video type <br>
  4a. Do something to search similar existing tags
